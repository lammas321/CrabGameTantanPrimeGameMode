# CrabGameTantanPrimeGameMode
A BepInEx mod for Crab Game that adds a more challenging and configurable version of the vanilla Crab Fight game mode.

Depends on [CustomGameModes](https://github.com/lammas321/CrabGameCustomGameModes)

- Watch out for falling crabs
- Good luck, you'll need it ;)

## WHY!?
Why not? :)

## How can I configure Tantan Prime?
The mod will create a "lammas123.TantanPrimeGameMode.cfg" file in your "BepInEx/config/" directory, all of the options you can configure are there.

Any changes to the config will be read once the game mode is picked and starts loading, meaning you won't have to restart your game or type a command to apply any changes you make.

## What's Tantan SUPREME!?
That is currently unavailable, but it will be once I create the ChatTriggers mod. :)
